/* FUNCTIONS
Function - self contained unit of program, perform tasks - causes action or find program value or status of insformation

Functions need to be small and cohesive 
-reduces complexity
-seperate functions are written for each subtask

Functions reduce duplication of code
Helps with readability 

Programmers think of function as a black box:
  Info that goes in (its input)
  The value or action it produces (its output)
  * Hlps u concentrate on the programs overall design rather than the details of what the func should do & how it relates to the program as a whole before worrying about the code

printf()
  First argument is usually a string literal, succeeding arguments are a series of variables or expressions whose vlues are to be displayed
 
 scanf() canr eceive info back from function in two ways
  -Input is stored in an address that you supply as an argument
  -As a return value
