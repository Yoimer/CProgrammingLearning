/* TYPE CONVERSION
int main()
{
    int x = 0;
    float f = 12.5;
    x = f;
    printf("The value of x is: %d",x);
}


THE CAST OPERATOR_
Explicit type conversion

int main()
{
    int x = 0;
    x = (int)21.51+(int)26.99; would be evaluated as 21+26 in C
    printf("The value of x is: %d\n", x);
}

SIZEOF OPERATORS

sizeof(int) will result i the number of bytes occupied by type int
you can use if to an expression --> the result if the size of the value that results from evaluating the expression

use sizeof to avoid having to calculate and hard-code sizes in your program

OTHER OPERATORS
* represents a pointer to a variable
? ternary operator
    is an operator used for comparisons
    if true ? then value X: otherwise value Y
discuss later when we talk about pointers and decision statements
